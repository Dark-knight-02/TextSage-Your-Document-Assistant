2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Setup
Before running the application, ensure you have the necessary API keys and configurations set:

1. **API Keys**:

- Obtain API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone.
- Set these keys in your environment variables or a configuration file.

2. **Configuration File**:

- Create a config.json file in the root directory and fill it with your API keys and other necessary configurations.


## Running the Application

Running TextSage locally involves a few simple steps once you have completed the installation and setup. Hereâ€™s how you can get it up and running:

### Prerequisites

Before launching the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and properly configured:

- **Python 3.9.6**: Ensure that Python is installed and working in your development environment.
- **API Keys**: Ensure that you have obtained the necessary API keys and added them to your environment variables or a designated configuration file as outlined in the [Setup](#setup) section.

### Steps to Run

1. **Open Terminal**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Change into the directory where you have cloned the TextSage repository.
     ```bash
     cd path/to/TextSage
     ```

3. **Activate Python Environment** (Optional)
   - If you are using a virtual environment, activate it:
     ```bash
     source your_env/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
     .\your_env\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
     ```

4. **Start the Application**
   - Run the application using Streamlit:
     ```bash
